# Diary Planner App

Description: small daily diary app for keeping track of commitments and reminders throughout the week.

Motivation:
- I was using a calendar home page called tweek (https://tweek.so) but the dark mode was locked behind a paywall.
- I want to be able to be in control of my home page so that I can customise the theme in the future.
- Want a day project to learn some new technology (tailwind css and unintentionally Google Apps Scripts)

Technology:
- html/js
- tailwind css
- google sheets
- google apps script

How to get running:
1. Create an empty Google Sheet
2. Menu: Extensions->Apps Script
3. Copy both the Code.gs and the Index.html into the empty project given
4. Deploy

Potential improvements:
- Improve styling
- Turn the textareas into a todo list that more closely resembles tweek?
- Add a secondary sheet where I can add useful home page links to jump around

Takeaway:
- Google app sheets is really useful for banging out simple apps with extremely simple data structures. May use this again in the future if the usecase comes up again.
- Google app sheets text editor is really not helpful
- Tailwind css is great but having to rewrite long class strings over and over isn't great, I think this would pair up far better with React or some other component based framework
